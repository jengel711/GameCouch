<h1>All About Us</h1>
<p>GameCouch started in a Long Island basement in 1990 by a group of friends, Gladys, Spencer, Nathan, Amira, and Ahmad, 
who were passionate about board games and sharing them with their community. Less than a year later, 
we moved to a storefront in Manhattan. With more space, we could provide a wider selection of board games and wargames, 
attracting more customers. As our business grew, we opened a location on Long Island, and began to expand to nearby states.
